# Python Whatsapp Bot
A selenium whatsapp bot written in Python 3. And it can take commands without API!

To use it:
1- You have to create a new firefox profile then link that created profile to selenium. Otherwise Whatsapp won't stay signed in.
  To create profile for selenium in Linux follow the steps.

2- (Sometimes)You need to change elements to detect.
  I have tested code in 2 different Linux machines.
  
3- And of course you should edit current command or add new ones.

Enjoy :)
